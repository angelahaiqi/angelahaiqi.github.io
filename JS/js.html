        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Jennifer Sue is a small fashion doll business that was created in the early 2000s. They design 
                dolls and doll clothing/accessories. Since I personally knew the owner, I worked part-time for them, first in sales and 
                then product development. Jennifer Sue was successful in its early years, but overtime, sales began to decrease. I 
                felt a major reason was its lack of proper digital outreach. Jennifer Sue was not on social media and its website had not 
                been updated since 2012. I therefore took the initiative to create social media accounts and redesign the website.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Redesign the Jennifer Sue website so that it is more modern, visually pleasing, and user-friendly.</span></p>
            <p align = "justify">The Jennifer Sue website had not been updated for several years, and it showed with its old design. 
                From going through it in-depth, I also noted some strange user experiences. </p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "original1.jpg" alt = "original">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">This is what the site initially looked like when you entered 
                jenniferdolls.com. The customer is supposed to click on the product they're interested in, leading them to 
                the product page. From there, they have access to the rest of the website (notably, the menu). The logic was to promote the newest 
                products. The idea wasn't bad, but I felt the execution was potentially confusing, since it's not clear you're 
                supposed to click on the images. Not showing the menu further removes clear navigation.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "original2.jpg" alt = "original">
        <img class = "img" src = "original3.jpg" alt = "original">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">After clicking into one of the images, you have access to all the other pages in the website. 
                This is the about page. It's typical for doll companies to create a biography for the doll. There's also a 
                section about the doll's physical attributes.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "original4.jpg" alt = "original">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Jennifer Sue in the news.</span> I also felt this page could be cleaned up a bit. Also note one of 
                the menu options: "Link." It did not lead to anywhere.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "original5.jpg" alt = "original">
        <img class = "img" src = "original6.jpg" alt = "original">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The Jennifer Sue dolls.</span> As you can see, the description 
                is stretched out a lot, making the page unnecessarily wide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">After taking note about issues with the website, I researched other doll companies. One of the 
                biggest fashion doll companies is Integrity Toys.</p>
        </div>
        <figure>
            <img class = "img" src = "integrity1.png" alt = "integrity toys">
            <img class = "img" src = "integrity2.png" alt = "integrity toys">
            <figcaption>Home page + Doll page</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Integrity Toys' site was simple yet sophisticated. It allowed customers to focus on their dolls 
                while projecting the image that these dolls are high-end. I used this website along with other eCommerce sites 
                as inspiration. The Jennifer Sue website was built with Yahoo Small Business, so I used that platform to redesign. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>The Result</h2>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "home1.jpg" alt = "home">
        <img class = "img" src = "home2.jpg" alt = "home">
        <img class = "img" src = "home3.png" alt = "home">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The new home page.</span> Pink and black are Jennifer Sue's colors, hence the 
                usage of them throughout the website. When I redesigned the website, I not only changed the appearance of the 
                home page, but also included Jennifer Sue's biography (and also a description of the company itself). 
                By giving the customer immediate access to some key information, this redesign reduces the amount of steps needed to 
                learn more about Jennifer Sue and piques interest.</p>
            <p align = "justify">I included real reviews and news coverages on the home page as well to help build more 
                trust in Jennifer Sue. Lastly, I added the contact information at the bottom of the page. Unfortunately, 
                Small Business would not let me change the colors of the links, but at least it's clear they can be clicked on.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "about.jpg" alt = "about">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The about page.</span> I decided to create a separate page for the 
                founder's story and include a more in-depth description of the company, so that the user isn't 
                overloaded with information on the home page. I removed "Jennifer's Journal," which was meant to be like a 
                diary for the doll, because the company had stopped working on it for years and had no intention on reviving it.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "dolls.png" alt = "dolls"><br>
        <img class = "img" src = "clothing.png" alt = "clothing"><br>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The dolls page (first image) and the clothing page (second image).</span> For the dolls, 
                I used photos showing their full bodies instead of just their faces like in the previous design. I felt it was important to 
                present the full body of the doll, as opposed to its face, so that customers have the best idea of what they're 
                clicking into. Similarly, with other products such as clothing, I thought the photos should allow the customers 
                to see the products clearly.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "doll1.jpg" alt = "doll"><br>
        <img class = "img" src = "doll2.jpg" alt = "doll"><br>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Individual doll page.</span> I was able to create a cart with HTML, so I 
            added an "add to bag" button that the original website did not have. Small Business does not offer much flexibility, 
            so I needed to create an extra section for the button. I decided to use the extra space to include more photos. Other 
            product pages are set up this way too.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "contact.jpg" alt = "contact"><br>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">And finally, I created a <span class = "bold">contact page</span> so customers can directly 
                reach out to Jennifer Sue!</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Jennifer Sue's brand awareness and sales increased after the website was redesigned and social media 
                accounts were activated. The one problem I found with the website was its responsiveness. Small Business did not allow me to 
                make mobile-only features or dimensions. I had to do my best to fit the product photos into the mobile frames provided 
                and make sure the most important parts were not cut off. Had I found a way to make the mobile layout a little less awkward, I think 
                our sales would increase even more.</p>
            <p align = "justify">This was the first project I took on that affected a real company. I had to learn to be strategic 
                in my design, as opposed to just seeing if it looked pretty. Putting myself in the shoes of the customer taught me so much 
                about UX and web design. Additionally, using Small Business tested my problem-solving skills. I had to think 
                outside the box to get around Small Business' limitations. If I were to redo this project, I would test my 
                design before releasing it (and find an alternative to Small Business).</p>
