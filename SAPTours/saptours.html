        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">My friend, a developer, asked me to design a web application with him for Brandeis University's 
                admissions office that would allow college tour guides to effectively schedule tours. It is now currently in use.</p>

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">My friend was a student tour guide for our alma mater, Brandeis University. The guides shared an 
                Excel sheet that contained everyone's information and a list of upcoming tours. On the 
                Excel sheet, guides could pick up available tours by typing their name next to them. This system might've been alright if there were only a few 
                guides or tours were infrequent. But Brandeis had tours throughout each week, even multiple times in a day, 
                and 40+ guides, with more being hired each semester. The sheet became a monstrous block of information that was difficult to navigate.
                As a result, tours were not being picked up fast enough. The lead tour guide or guide supervisor would often have to step in and 
                assign tours. Noticing this problem, my friend pitched an idea to develop a tour-scheduling app and asked me to be the designer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">The tour-scheduling process, which relied on an Excel sheet, was tedious and clunky. 
                How could I design an app that would make the process easier and more efficient?</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">The first step was understanding who our users were and what they needed. To do this, we consulted with the lead tour guide 
                and guide supervisor. Since my friend was a regular student tour guide, I would also ask him questions on how their team functioned. I 
                learned two key things:</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">Guides were typically supposed to sign up for tours themselves, but may be assigned certain ones, 
                either due to lack of coverage or because the supervisor felt they would be a good fit (eg. if a tour group was made up of prospective international 
                students, a guide who was an international student themself should probably lead them). If a guide needed to drop a tour, they were responsible for finding a replacement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Based on these facts, I created a persona to cement my understanding of our users.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Mitchell Sanders.png" alt = "user persona">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Essentially, our users, the student tour guides, needed these features:</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">1.</span> The ability to immediately see what tours were available and pick them up.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">2.</span> The ability to find other guides' info, so that they could contact them.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">3.</span> The ability to set/edit their availability, so that other guides or the supervisors can see if they could possibly cover a certain tour. 
                Since guides are all busy students, there should also be a way to ensure no one is contacted too often.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>App Research</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Once we had a good idea on the user base, we needed to figure out what type of platform to build. We had three 
            options: a web app, a mobile app, or an automation process. We analyzed the pros and cons of each.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Platform Analysis.png" alt = "platform analysis">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">We ruled out the automation process fairly quickly, due to its lack of utility. That left us deciding between a web 
                and mobile app. We asked the guides what device they used when scheduling tours and found <span class = "bold">all of them pretty exclusively used their laptops.</span> 
                Web app was definitely the way to go, which was lucky for my friend since it would be slightly easier for him to code than mobile.</p>
            <p align = "justify">In terms of the app's interface, we felt a <span class = "bold">calendar-based app</span> made the most sense, since 
                it would clearly show all the tour times for each month. I researched calendar apps, such as Google Calendar, to see what the best practices were.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Google Calendar.png" alt = "google calendar">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">As I mentioned before, sometimes a guide will be assigned to a specific tour. In order to determine if a guide would be a good fit for a tour, 
            their personal information, such as field of study or hometown, would have to be stored somewhere. I looked into social media apps, such as Facebook 
            and Instagram, for inspiration on how a profile should be designed.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Social Media.png" alt = "social media apps">
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>The Result</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Now that the research was done, it was time to design! I created a few drafts, going back and forth with my friend to see 
                what he was able or unable to develop. Eventually, I reached a design that I was happy with and also seemed feasible enough. We presented this design 
                to the Admissions Office and after hearing their feedback, my friend began to code.</p>
            <p align = "justify">My design did not end up being fully implemented, due to further technical limitations and the Admissions Office prioritizing 
                different things. However, the general idea is there. Below is my vision. <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3ub-X_0zev6GJs1OonX1RLFcJ6IeQvm?usp=sharing">Here are screenshots of the real app.</a></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "SAP Login.png" alt = "login">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Login page.</span> Login and signup are displayed together. Given how the Admissions Office was constantly hiring new guides, I felt it was important for the onboarding process 
                to be prominent and straightforward. At the same time, current guides needed to check the app frequently, so login shouldn't 
                be hidden either.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Home Page.png" alt = "home"> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The home page.</span> The calendar interface makes it intuitive to use. Guides can instantly see all the tours for that month and know from the colored dots 
                which ones need coverage. There is a legend at the top in case they forget what a color represents. 
                Guides have the option to only view their own tours. They can also download the calendar so they have a copy of it.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Tour Info.png" alt = "tour info">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Covering a tour.</span> Guides can click on each tour and find information 
            about it. They can then choose to cover the tour.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Guide List.png" alt = "guides">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The guide list.</span> Everyone's contact info is clearly displayed. For extra convenience, 
                their emails are linked. One of the Excel sheet's problems was the lack of organization for the guides' information, so I included a 
                filter and sort. Guides can, for example, filter by field of study or sort by alphabetical order. For more information, they can view 
                each other's profiles.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Profile 1.png" alt = "profile">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Profile page.</span> Guides fill out all their information here. 
                The information is organized into different categories. The social media profiles I researched had the info on separate lines to be more mobile-friendly. 
                Guides very strongly prefered to use their laptops, so we decided not to focus on mobile and since there's a lot to fill out, 
                we put info on the same lines. This way, guides don't need to do the extra work of scrolling.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Profile 2.png" alt = "availability">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Guides indicate their availability here. To help prevent a guide from being assigned too many tours, I added a space where they could enter a minimum/maximum number of tours per month.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Profile 3.png" alt = "stats">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">My friend and I wanted to include a stats feature to serve as a reference for guides and the supervisors. 
            Admissions felt this feature was unnecessary and it wasn't super easy to code anyway, so this idea was scrapped (for now).</p>
        </div><br>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">We named our app SAPTours (Student Ambassador Program Tours). 
                My friend finished coding it and released it in December 2019. It is now currently being used. We received a lot of positive responses: guides 
                have been finding it easy to use.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">This project was a great opportunity for me because it was an app that was actually 
                going to be used. I can see how my design helped solve a real problem people were facing, which was incredibly fulfilling.</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">I learned a lot about compromise.</span> The developer is not always going to be able to 
                implement all of my ideas. The client's needs and priorities won't always align with my vision. Keeping these in mind 
                definitely affected my approach to designing. I also found myself grateful for my Computer Science background, since I was able 
                to communicate with the developer in the same language.</p> 
            <p align = "justify">Moving forward, we may need to update the app to support any future needs. There were 
                also some features we were unable to implement but would like to one day, such as the tour statistics
                shown in my wireframe. If I were to redo the project, I would test my design before its official release 
                to ensure we were headed in the right direction.</p>
