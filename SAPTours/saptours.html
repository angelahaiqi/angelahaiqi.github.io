        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">This past summer, a friend asked me to design a web application with him for our school's 
                admissions office that would allow college tour guides to effectively schedule tours. It is now currently in use.</p>

        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">My friend is a student tour guide for our school. At the beginning of each semester, 
                the coordinator team releases the potential slots of tours. Guides are also given a calendar created by the 
                coordinators at the beginning of the month. Tour guides enter their availability on a sheet, and then 
                coordinators are responsible for randomizing which tour guides give a tour every single month. This process 
                ended up being inefficient, messy, and confusing. My friend therefore pitched the idea of creating an app that 
                would allow them to efficiently schedule tours, and asked me to be the UX/UI designer.</p>

        <div class = "title">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Design a web app that would make scheduling tours easy and efficient. And can be coded by my partner.</span></p>
            <p align = "justify">My friend first showed me their old scheduling process. The tour guides shared a 
                giant Excel sheet that contained everyone's information and schedules, and any upcoming tours. Through the 
                Excel sheet, guides picked up any tours that were available. With so much unorganized information in one 
                place, it was tedious to navigate and extremely difficult to keep track of what other guides were doing. 
                As a result, he received approval from the Admissions Office to design an app that would streamline the 
                tour-scheduling process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>The Process</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Before we could think about how we wanted the app to work, we first had to think about 
            <span class = "bold">what kind</span> of app we wanted. We had three options: web app, mobile app, and automation process. 
            We analyzed the pros and cons of each platform.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "platform_analysis.png" alt = "platform analysis">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Ultimately, we chose to create a web app as we felt it would offer the most utility. 
                My friend would code it using React. From there, we brainstormed necessary features and consulted 
                with the lead tour guide and guide supervisor. We defined two types of users and their functionalities:</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "users.png" alt = "users">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">From there, we came up with other features:</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">1.</span> Admins can add tour times, along with how many tours are available. <br><br>
                <span class = "bold">2.</span> Tour guides would add in their availability for the tour times created. 
                They could edit this availability at any time. They could also set a minimum number of tours.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">3.</span> Admins could see a list of active/inactive tour guides at any time. Only admins could 
                inactivate a tour guide.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">4.</span> E-mails would be sent out 24 hours before tours to remind students.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">5.</span> If a tour guide drops a tour, an e-mail would be sent out to all tour guides 
                with that time marked as available. They could them claim the tour, and it would be assigned to them.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">6.</span> List of tour guides with searchable majors/potentially clubs, to help see if a 
                guide is a good match for a specific tour group (ex. a guide who is an international student could be a better 
                fit for a group of prospective international students).</p>
            <p align = "justify">Since it's a scheduling app, we decided a calendar-based app was the way to go. 
                I researched other calendar apps, such as Google Calendar, for inspiration. I also looked into 
                numerous social media apps, such as Facebook and Instagram, for the tour guide profiles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>The Result</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">We decided to call our app <span class = "bold">SAPTours (Student Ambassador Program Tours)</span>. 
                My friend finished coding it and released it in December 2019. It is now currently being used by our school's 
                admissions office. The logo, a college building, was created by me using Illustrator. The app's colors, blue and 
                white, are our school's colors.</p>
            <p align = "justify">Due to technical limitations and differing opinions, the app does not completely match my vision, 
                but it has the general idea. Below is my vision, which is from the point of view of a guide since the admin features were created in the 
                backend. <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3ub-X_0zev6GJs1OonX1RLFcJ6IeQvm?usp=sharing">Here are screenshots of the real app.</a></p>

            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Login page.</span> I liked Facebook's straightforward approach to 
                logging in and creating an account, displaying both on the same page. New/current users know immediately 
                where to go. To ensure only Brandeis students can access it, the app checks for a Brandeis email. When 
                signing up, users must indicate their roles.</p>

                reference, and users have the option to only view their own tours. Users have the option 
                download the calendar to their Google Calendar so they have a copy of it. There is a menu on the top right-hand corner.</p>

        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">This project was a great opportunity for me because it's an app that was actually 
                going to be put into use. It was also my first time working with a developer, so I learned that 
                I sometimes needed to compromise to accommodate to their abilities. Since this app is 
                currently being used, my friend and I can see that users are able to learn it easily and efficiently 
                schedule tours. Moving forward, we may need to update the app to support any future needs. There were 
                also some features we were unable to implement but would like to one day, such as the analytics feature 
                shown in my wireframe.</p>
