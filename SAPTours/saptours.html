                    admissions office that would allow college tour guides to effectively schedule tours. It is now currently in use.</p>

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">My friend was a student tour guide for our alma mater, Brandeis University. The guides shared an 
                Excel sheet that contained everyone's information and a list of upcoming tours. On the 
                Excel sheet, guides could pick up available tours by typing their name next to them. Despite how straightforward this seemed, the Admissions Office was 
                finding that tours were not being picked up fast enough. The lead tour guides would often have to step in and assign tours, which was very 
                time-consuming. My friend, based on personal experience and the complaints of other guides, believed the problem 
                lay in the Excel sheet. Brandeis had tours throughout each week, even multiple times in a day, and 40+ guides, with more being hired each semester. 
                The sheet was a monstrous block of information that was difficult to navigate. As a result, my friend pitched the idea to develop a 
                tour-scheduling app and asked me to be the designer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">The tour-scheduling process, which relied on an Excel sheet, was too tedious. 
                How could I design an app that would make the process easier and more efficient?</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">The first step was understanding who our users were and what they needed. To do this, we consulted with the lead tour guides. Since my friend 
                was a regular student tour guide, I would also ask him questions on how their team functioned. I learned two key things:</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">1. Guides were meant to be fairly autonomous. They were expected to sign up for most tours themselves. If a guide needed to drop a tour, 
            they were also responsible for finding a replacement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">2. The lead tour guide does everything a regular guide does, with the added responsibility of sometimes assigning tours. Tours may 
                be assigned either due to lack of coverage, or because a specific guide would be a good fit for them (eg. if a tour group was made up of prospective international 
                students, a guide who was an international student themself should probably lead them). 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Based on these facts, I determined that there were two types of users: regular tour guides and lead tour guides. I created 
            personas for them to cement my understanding:</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Mitchell Sanders.png" alt = "guide persona">
        <img class = "img" src = "Isabelle Wu.png" alt = "lead guide persona">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">I also created journey maps to highlight the steps they took to achieve their goals:</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Mitchell's Journey.png" alt = "guide journey">
        <img class = "img" src = "Isabelle's Journey.png" alt = "lead guide journey">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Essentially, the regular and lead guides needed these features:</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">1.</span> The ability to immediately see what tours were available and pick them up.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">2.</span> The ability to find other guides' info, so that they could contact them.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">3.</span> The ability to set/edit their availability, so that other guides can see if they could possibly cover a certain tour. 
                Since guides are all busy students, there should also be a way to ensure no one is contacted too often.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">4.</span> The lead guides specifically needed the ability to find everyone's backgrounds for tour matching.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>App Research</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Once we had a good idea on the user base, we needed to figure out what type of platform to build. We asked the guides what device they used when scheduling tours and found <span class = "bold">all of them pretty exclusively used their laptops.</span> 
                Web app was definitely the way to go, which was lucky for my friend since it would be slightly easier for him to code than mobile.</p>
            <p align = "justify">In terms of the app's interface, we felt a <span class = "bold">calendar-based app</span> made the most sense, since 
                it would clearly show all the tour times for each month. I researched calendar apps, such as Google Calendar, to see what the best practices were.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Google Calendar.png" alt = "google calendar">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">As I mentioned before, sometimes a guide will be assigned to a specific tour. In order to determine if a guide would be a good fit for a tour, 
            their personal information, such as field of study or hometown, would have to be stored somewhere. I looked into social media apps, such as Facebook, for inspiration on how a profile should be designed.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Social Media.png" alt = "social media apps">
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>The Result</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Now that the research was done, it was time to design! I created a few drafts, going back and forth with my friend to see 
                what he was able or unable to develop. Eventually, I reached a design that I was happy with and also seemed feasible enough.</p>
            <p align = "justify">My design did not end up being fully implemented, due to further technical limitations. However, the general idea is there. Below is my vision.</p>
            </div>

        <!---<img class = "img" src = "SAP Login.png" alt = "login">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Login page.</span> Login and sign up are displayed together. Given how the Admissions Office was constantly hiring new guides, I felt it was important for the onboarding process 
                to be prominent and straightforward. At the same time, current guides needed to check the app frequently, so login shouldn't 
                be hidden either.</p>
        </div>--->
        <img class = "img" src = "Home Page.png" alt = "home"> 
        <img class = "img" src = "Menu.png" alt = "menu"> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The home page.</span> The calendar interface makes it intuitive to use. Guides can instantly see all the tours for that month and know from the colored dots 
                which ones need coverage. There is a legend at the top in case they forget what a color represents. 
                Guides have the option to only view their own tours. They can also download the calendar so they have a copy of it. At the upper right corner is a 
                dropdown menu where guides can access other pages.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Tour Info.png" alt = "tour info">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Covering a tour.</span> Guides can click on each tour and find information 
            about it. We included a section on how many guides were needed and how many were currently covering so that the lead guides knew how many more to 
            add if need be. They can also see who is already covering the tour.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Profile 1.png" alt = "profile">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Profile page.</span> Guides fill out all their information here.  
                Following what I saw in social media profiles, the information is organized into different categories. When viewing another guide's profile, the setup is the same as here except there's no 
                save button.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Profile 2.png" alt = "availability">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Guides indicate their availability here. To help prevent a guide from being assigned too many tours, I added a space where they could enter a minimum/maximum number 
            of tours per month. This feature works with the guide list which I'll discuss next.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Guide List.png" alt = "guides">
        <img class = "img" src = "Filters.png" alt = "filters">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The guide list.</span> Since guides are responsible for finding a replacement if they need to drop a tour, 
            I made a page where everyone's contact info is clearly displayed. Their emails are also linked for extra convenience. One problem with the Excel sheet was the 
            lack of organization, so I included a filter and sort. Guides can sort the list to their liking, for example, by alphabetical order. The filter is more 
            for the lead guides. To see which guides could be a match for a specific tour, the lead guides can filter the list by field of study or US citizenship. I considered displaying 
            every piece of information in the list, but since there's so much, I was afraid it would end up overwhelming the guides. As a result, I have the list, by default, only 
            show the guides' contact info. Through the filters, leads can display relevant information. If the leads wanted to see a more comprehensive background, 
            they would click on the guide's name to view their profile. There is also a toggle to hide guides who have hit their maximum number of tours for the month.</p>
        </div><br>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">We named our app SAPTours (Student Ambassador Program Tours). 
                My friend finished coding it and released it in December 2019. It is now currently being used. We received a lot of positive responses: guides 
                have been finding it easy to use and are picking up more tours on their own.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">This project was a great opportunity for me because it was an app that was actually 
                going to be used. I can see how my design helped solve a real problem people were facing, which was incredibly fulfilling.</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">I learned a lot about compromise.</span> The developer is not always going to be able to 
                implement all of my ideas. The client's needs and priorities won't always align with my vision. Keeping these in mind 
                definitely affected my approach to designing. I also found myself grateful for my Computer Science background, since I was able 
                to communicate with the developer in the same language.</p> 
            <p align = "justify">Moving forward, we may need to update the app to support any future needs. There were 
                also some features we were unable to implement but would like to one day, such as tour statistics. If I were to redo the project, I would test my design before its official release 
                to ensure we were headed in the right direction.</p>
