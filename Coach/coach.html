            <p align = "justify">Coach wanted to connect to their customers in a new, innovative way. 
                How could we design a mobile app that would appeal to all demographics, especially Gen Z, while maintaining Coach's values
                and brand?</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Coach.com was seeing a huge jump in the number of mobile visitors. 
                There was also a huge increase in conversion rates through mobile. As a result, Coach was exploring the 
                introduction of a mobile app for consumers to use at home and potentially in stores to enhance the Coach 
                shopping experience. Many of their rival companies had developed mobile apps to capitalize on convenience and 
                open a new line of communication between customer and brand. Coach also faced difficulties connecting to 
                younger generations and wanted to change that.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Before working on the actual design, we needed to get an idea of what consumers are 
                looking for. Our research found that <span class = "bold">Augmented/Virtual Reality</span> was one of the big technological trends. 
                The Gucci app, for example, uses AR to allow users to try on shoes and glasses. Through more research and 
                interviewing Tapestry employees, we found these other key points:</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">1.</span> 57% of customers are using mobile apps while in-store.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">2.</span> 48% of shoppers would be more likely to shop at a retailer that utilizes AR/VR. <br><br>
                <span class = "bold">3.</span> Wish lists/favorites features is a major reason why people would prefer mobile app over website. <br><br>
                <span class = "bold">4.</span> Gen Z is a rewards-driven group, with 83% showing greater loyalty to brands that 
                provide rewards and surprises.</p>

        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Since the app would mainly target Gen Z, we developed a Gen Z persona to further help us understand 
            what the app needed.</p><br>

        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Based off of our research, we decided to create an app that would:</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">1.</span> Utilize AR/VR to allow users to quickly try on products in/out of stores.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">2.</span> Build an online community by letting users share/save photos/products and 
                featuring social media influencers/Coach ambassadors.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">3.</span> Utilize a rewards system to incentivize users to keep using the app.</p>
            <p align = "justify">Once we formulated an idea, we created a flow chart to help us flesh out the details.</p><br>

        <div class = "text">

        <div class = "text"><p align = "justify">For further inspiration, we visited the recently opened Coach store in Hudson Yards, 
            NYC, since that's the store design Coach is pushing forward. There's a large pink room in the store, so 
            we decided to make pink a motif in the app. The store also has a customization lab that features a 
            neon sign on a metal fence, so we made that a motif as well.</p><br>

            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">These wireframes are redesigns of the ones submitted, following 
                the judges' critiques that the social media platform felt a bit crowded. I was originally responsible for the

        <div class = "text">

                VR aspect of the app and symbolize viewing the world through Coach's eyes. The background is a peach color that 
                Coach commonly uses for their products.</p><br>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "home_page.png" alt = "home">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The home page.</span> Since this is the page users see first, we wanted it to get them 
                excited about exploring the app. The top section would feature a new, exciting thing happening at Coach. In this wireframe, 
                users can watch Coach's collection at NYFW live, only on the app. Below could be new arrivals and the latest posts from 
                Coach's ambassadors.
                At the very top, users can search through the app and access their virtual fitting room and bag. 
                The bottom nav bar shows the core sections.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "connect_page.png" alt = "connect">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">To appeal to Gen Z, we created a <span class = "bold">social platform</span> where people can share how they wear 
                Coach and save posts made by others. Users can also follow Coach's ambassadors. The posts are listed 
                in a blog-like layout, as opposed to a standard grid, to make the page more fun and interesting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The shop page.</span> To organize the products better, women's, men's, and sale products are 
                divided up and everything can be sorted and filtered. Again, note the blog layout for the products. Users also have the 
                option to save items they like.</p><br>

        <img class = "img" src = "Fitting Room.png" alt = "fitting room"><br>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The fitting room.</span> The fitting room. When users first set 
                up an account, they are asked to create an avatar, which they can edit anytime. The avatar can try on 
                all the products to give users an idea what they would look like on them. We felt this feature was 
                important because many people hesitate to buy products online out of fear that it would look bad on them. </p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "camera_page.png" alt = "camera"><br>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">To make the app usable in stores, we've included a <span class = "bold">camera</span> where users 
                can take photos of a product and try them on virtually. This would help users save time 
                from waiting for an available fitting room and putting on/taking off items. They would also have the option to save or share 
                the photo.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "profile_page.png" alt = "profile"><br>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Your <span class = "bold">profile page</span> is where you can edit your avatar and view your saved posts. 
                You can also view your <span class = "bold">rewards.</span> A rewards system would further motivate people to use the app. We created a 
                rewards system where people can win Coach charms that are used for customization. The system is based 
                off of Snapchat trophies. There are different sets of charms, where each charm builds off of each other. 
                For example, to unlock the Black Tea Rose, users would need to spend over $100. To unlock the Blue Tea Rose, 
                users would need to spend at $200, and to unlock the Purple Tea Rose, a $1000. Each reward would offer a 
                discount or access to an event or sale. There's an expiration date for the rewards so that users can't 
                stack too many discounts on top of each other and get items for free.

            <h2>Feedback & Reflection</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Responses from the judges were positive. They found our design to be creative and 
                innovative. The one critique they had was our original social media platform felt a bit crowded. Corrections to 
                this were made.</p>
            <p align = "justify">This was my first time designing a mobile app, and for a large company. 
                <span class = "bold">I was pushed to think bigger and smaller at the same time: I had to come up with innovative 
                ideas while keeping in mind that a phone screen is tiny.</span> It was a new experience that 
                helped me grow greatly. If I were to redo it, I would test the design with users to see how they respond.
