        <div class = "title">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Summer 2019, I was an intern at Kate Spade. Kate Spade, Coach, and Stuart Weitzman are all owned by 
                Tapestry. Tapestry had a case study competition for all its interns and I was placed in a team of six. My teammates and I, who had either a 
                design or business background, were tasked with ideating a mobile app for Coach.</p> 
            <p align = "justify">Why? Coach.com was seeing a huge jump in the number of mobile visitors, along with a huge increase in conversion rates through mobile. 
                Many of their rival companies had already developed mobile apps to capitalize on convenience and open a new line of communication between customer 
                and brand. Coach was also facing difficulties connecting to younger generations and wanted to change that.
                As a result, Coach was exploring the introduction of a mobile app for consumers to use at home and potentially in stores to 
                enhance the Coach shopping experience. </p>   
        </div>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">Coach wanted to connect to their customers in an innovative way. 
                How could we design a mobile app that would appeal to all demographics, especially Gen Z, while maintaining Coach's values
                and brand?</p>
        </div>  
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Before working on the actual design, we needed to deepen our understanding of the target demographic: Generation Z. 
                Luxury brands in general have long been associated with older people due to their high prices. Competitors such as Gucci managed to find ways to connect to 
                younger people, but Coach had not.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">Why did this matter? What was so important about Gen Z?</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Our research found that <span class ="bold">consumers under the age of 30 loved to shop online due to its convenience</span>. Gen Z, 
            in particular, was estimated to have a spending power of <span class ="bold">$143 billion</span>. It was no wonder that Coach wanted to tap into 
            that market, and the best way to do so was through mobile.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Through more research and interviewing younger Tapestry employees, we discovered other key insights on Gen Z:</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Stats.png" alt = "stats"><br>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">We concluded that Gen Z valued meaningful incentives and interactions. It wasn't enough to simply have an app. The 
                experience needed to be engaging.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Apps take up space in users' smartphones. There needed to be a good reason to download them, to use them over 
            a company's mobile site. Offering tools that mobile sites didn't have, such as wish lists, were one reason. Incentives such as rewards were another (we 
            suspected this was because Gen Z'ers didn't have a proper income and therefore jumped at any opportunity to save money). Since Gen Z'ers 
            were more likely to purchase from brands they follow on social media, we also concluded that Gen Z'ers valued building relationships. Lastly, 
            despite shopping online so frequently, Gen Z'ers still liked to visit stores in person and expected interesting experiences there.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">We created a Gen Z persona to tie all these findings together:</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Emily Young.png" alt = "persona">
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>Market Research</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Gen Z clearly valued new and innovative technology. What sort of technology was out there, and how were they being used?</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">We researched technological trends and found that <span class = "bold">Augmented and Virtual Reality were growing rapidly, 
             with 48% of shoppers saying they were more likely to shop at retailers that utilized them.</span> Gucci, in fact, was using AR to allow customers to 
             try on sneakers.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "gucci.png" alt = "gucci">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">The reasoning behind this was because customers may hesitate to buy something online if they're unsure how it would look on them. 
            We thought this was a great idea that didn't just need to be limited to shoes. Why not let users try on other items as well? We looked into the feasibility of that. 
            AR required customers to use a camera, which could be tricky for trying on tops or bottoms. However, it was doable with VR, where customers could create an 
            avatar that would wear the clothes for them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Since Gen Z also cared for positive in-store experiences, we researched methods for Coach stores to use advanced technology. <span class = "bold">QR 
            codes</span> were becoming increasingly popular due to their convenience: all users need to do is scan them with their phone camera. We decided that QR codes could 
            work with VR. An in-store customer could scan an item they liked and virtually try it on, saving them the time needed to find a fitting room and change.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "qr.png" alt = "qr code">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">So VR technology might capture Gen Z'ers initial attention, but trends don't last forever. <span class = "bold">How do we ensure that Gen Z'ers developed a real love for Coach? 
            How do we maintain interest?</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">We dived into the relationship between Gen Z and social media. Many Gen Z'ers said they were more likely to purchase from brands they followed 
            on social media, and we also found that <span class = "bold">97% of Gen Z'ers were using social media, particularly Instagram, as their top source for fashion inspiration</span>. Gen Z'ers wanted to 
            know what peers were up to, what the latest trends were. Brands were beginning to take advtantage of that by developing online personalities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "highlight">
            <p align = "justify">By prioritizing organic content, brands would feel more like people, as opposed to companies, creating a more personal connection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">We decided that a social platform where customers can share photos of themselves wearing Coach products would create that desired connection. First, 
            it would help Gen Z'ers feel that regular people like them could pull of Coach products. Second, it could serve as a reference: if a customer wasn't sure how to style something, they could receive inspiration 
            from other customers, removing their doubt of purchasing it. Since Gen Z'ers looked up to celebrities a lot, we decided the social platform should also feature Coach's ambassadors, 
            further pushing the image that Coach was a "cool" brand.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "ig.png" alt = "teva instagram">
        <figcaption>From Teva's instagram. The photos from regular people make the brand feel more accessible.</figcaption><br>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">The other aspect of maintaining customer interest was offering tangible incentives. Coach products were not cheap and since most young 
                people don't have a stable income, they may be deterred from making regular purchases. We found before that Gen Z'ers were crazy about rewards because they added more 
                benefits to their purchases, in the form of discounts and other perks. We looked into how competitors set up their rewards system to build customer loyalty. I decided to also
                research non-shopping apps that had a rewards system in place and found myself most drawn to Snapchat's.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "snapchat.png" alt = "snapchat">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Snapchat trophies are organized into sets, with the trophies of each set building on one another. In this example, users win the star 
            trophy by reaching a Snapchat score of 500. The next trophy in the set would be won by reaching an even higher score. I liked this idea because it encouraged users 
            to do the same few actions Snapchat wanted them to do (in this case, keep sending Snaps). Coach could leverage this idea to encourage users to keeping spending, 
            keep visiting stores, and more. This would also save Coach from needing to come up with many unique rewards.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Our final research phase focused on general eCommerce best practices for both experience and visuals. We analyzed the mobile apps of several 
            other brands, such as Chanel, Nike, and Louis Vuitton.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "Competitors.png" alt = "competitors">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">We liked the cleanliness and big images, but Coach's app could definitely be more fun and interesting!</p>

        <div class = "title">
            <h2>Ideation</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Based on our research, we decided to create an app that would:</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">1.</span> Utilize VR to allow customers to quickly try on products in/out of stores.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">2.</span> Build an online community by letting customers share/save photos/products and 
                featuring social media influencers/Coach ambassadors.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">3.</span> Utilize a rewards system to incentivize customers to keep using the app.</p>
            <p align = "justify">Once we formulated an idea, we created a flow chart to help us flesh out the details.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "flow_chart.jpg" alt = "flow chart">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">One of my teammates, Morgan Rossi, also drew a few amazing sketches to help think of the app's appearance! We especially loved her idea 
            of making the space where customers try on clothes look like a fitting room.

        <div class = "text"><p align = "justify">For further inspiration, we visited the recently opened Coach store in Hudson Yards, 
            NYC, since that's the store design Coach is pushing forward. There's a large pink room in the store, so 
            we decided to make pink a motif in the app. The store also has a customization lab that features a 
            neon sign on a metal fence, so we made that a motif as well.</p><br>

            <p align = "justify">To build the community Gen Z'ers crave, we created a <span class = "bold">social platform</span> where people can share how they wear 
                Coach and save posts made by others. Customers can also follow Coach's ambassadors. The posts are listed 
                in a blog-like layout, as opposed to a standard grid, to make the page more visually interesting. Following the judge's critique,

                from waiting for an available fitting room and putting on/taking off items. They can also take photos of the product itself

                Following Snapchat's design, there are different sets of charms, where each charm builds off of each other. 
                For example, to unlock the Black Tea Rose, customers would need to spend over $100. To unlock the Blue Tea Rose, 
                customers would need to spend over $500, and to unlock the Purple Tea Rose, a $1000. Each reward would offer a 
                discount or access to an event or sale. This would incentivize customers to keep using the app.</p>

            <p align = "justify">Responses from the judges were positive. They found our design to be creative and 
                innovative. The one critique they had was our original social media platform felt a bit crowded. Corrections to

            <p align = "justify">This was my first time designing a mobile app, and for a large company. 
                <span class = "bold">I was pushed to think bigger and smaller at the same time: I had to come up with innovative 
                ideas while keeping in mind that a phone screen is tiny.</span> It was a new experience that 
                helped me grow greatly. If I were to redo it, I would test the design with users to see how they respond.
