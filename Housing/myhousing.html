                Though they're able to apply for housing and dining in the end, there are still complaints about it being 
                confusing to use. Thus, my group and I chose to redesign it for our final HCI project.</p>

        <div class = "title">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">MyHousing is not efficient to use. It could do much more to help students select the right housing
                and dining for them. How could we redesign MyHousing so that it is more intuitive, efficient, and has 
                higher utility?</span></p>
            <p align = "justify">This is what the MyHousing home page currently looks like: </p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "original1.jpg" alt = "original">

        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">My entire team and I are students who have used MyHousing at least once. 
                Therefore, we could draw from personal experience to figure out how to improve MyHousing. 
                We all agreed that the menu was poorly designed: it is hard to read and there are too many options 
                for such little tasks. For example, "More Tasks" only contains the room condition report. We also all 
                felt that having access to floor plans in MyHousing would be helpful (currently, the floor plans are 
                placed on a page of the school's official website). Most importantly, we felt the actual housing/dining 
                selection process was not the most straightforward. You have to click quite a few links, while receiving 
                no confirmation that you're headed in the right direction.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p>Though we were confident in our beliefs, we still felt it was important to see exactly what other students 
                were thinking as well. As a result, we created a questionnaire that we sent to students we knew and posted 
                in social media groups. We received about thirty responses. We also conducted four interviews.</p>
            <p>The questionnaire and interviews yielded interesting results:<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">1.</span> From the questionnaire, 26%, the biggest percentile, ranked navigating MyHousing 
                to be a 6 on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being hardest and 10 being easiest. This contrasted from the interviewees 
                that claimed navigating MyHousing was more difficult (a 4 on average)<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">2.</span> No one could seem to remember how the housing/dining selection works. All they 
                know is that every year, they have to play around with the platform for a little bit and figure out how to 
                select housing/dining. <br><br>
                <span class = "bold">3.</span> All of the participants agreed that the direct access to floor plans from 
                MyHousing would be useful. <br><br>
                <span class = "bold">4.</span> All of the participants felt MyHousing does not do much to help find roommates. 
                They all have to rely on being able to request friends as roommates.<br><br>
                <span class = "bold">5.</span> In terms of removing features, they found the messaging platform unhelpful. 
                No one knew how to use it.</p>
            <p>Overall, we concluded that MyHousing is not that ineffective, but it does not meet its potential in helping students achieve their housing/meal plan goals.</p>

            <p align = "justify">Based off our responses, we thought of a design that was more straightforward and had higher
                utility by adding floor plans and a roommate matching system. We created a paper prototype to test our ideas. We had 
                ten subjects, all of whom were also students. Our tests utilized this scenario:</p>

                housing for next year. Sam wants to live in the Hassenfeld building of East Quad due to its close 
                proximity to his classes. He would prefer his room to be on the first or second floor so he 
                does not have to climb many stairs. Sam did not have a positive experience with his suitemates this year, so 
                he is also searching for a new roommate. His other friends already have housing plans, so he is hoping 
                that MyHousing could match him with someone compatible."</span></p>

                that our redesign was more efficient and useful. We did, however, receive a couple of suggestions. A major one 
                was to indicate which dorms still had available rooms, as some are way more popular than others, to save the user time.
                One subject also felt that our prototype was not always clear on which text was a link and which wasn't. Additionally, they 
                thought at first that the rooms shown on the East: Hassenfeld page were the only ones available. We had intended 
                for the page to be scrolled down to view all options. After collecting the feedback, we updated our design and 
                created our wireframes.</p>

                only options that really matter (with Housing having a drop-down of important tasks). We removed the "Home" 
                button and made the Brandeis logo act as that. We also designed it that during the housing selection period, 
                a banner indicating the user's selection time/number appears at the top as a reminder.</p>

                default to student ID photos, but users have to option of replacing it with a nicer photo. They can 
                also write a short bio and answer a lot of lifestyle questions. The answers to the questions are 
                crucial for roommate matching. If a user is viewing someone else's profile, the email will be linked.</p>

                roommates will always be pushed to the top, in case he wants to live with them again. He also has the option of 
                searching for anyone in the school. He can view people's profiles, send emails, and send roommate requests 
                (the other student will be notified through email if they receive a request and can accept through there).

                which rooms are available in each building. We also rearranged how each room was listed, making all the 
                options clearer. In each dorm, Sam can see the floor plan of a standard room as an added reference, though he will need to see the 
                actual floor plans for specific rooms. Once he has decided on a room, he can click on it and confirm his 
                selection. He also has the option to change his selection by clicking on another room and confirming for that. 
                Once he confirms, an email will be sent to him and his roommate(s) so they know the selection has been processed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Three teaching assistants evaluated our redesign. They felt the redesign was much more 
                intuitive and had higher utility, but could be clearer in a couple of aspects. They felt an explanation on what the 
                selection number meant would be helpful, and that the floor plans may not have enough information for underclassmen who 
                are not familiar with the different dorms. Overall, it was good but could be even better.</p>
            <p align = "justify">This project was the first time I was able to conduct usability testing. I was aware before about the importance of 
                testing, but now I can say I truly understand why it's needed. The paper prototype helped me see how users were responding 
                to my design, so I knew what to keep and what to change. The evaluation from the teaching assistants also reminded me 
                that any design has room for improvement. If I were to redo the assignment, I would incorporate their 
                feedback and expand some of the features more.</p>
