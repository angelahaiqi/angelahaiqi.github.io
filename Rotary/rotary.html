            <p align = "justify">My two teammates and I were finalists in DeisHacks, a 24-hour design/business competition targeted at real world solutions. 
                    For my project, I redesigned the Rotary Club of Waltham website.</p>

        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Around 30 non-profit organizations in the Waltham area came to my school with different challenges. 
                I was placed into the Rotary Club of Waltham with two students, Tim and Emily, who interned there. Rotary International is an 
                organization focused on community service, and they had a branch in Waltham that had trouble recruiting new volunteers. 
                One problem we found was that their website was extremely outdated and not user-friendly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Redesign the Waltham Rotary Club website so that it is more modern, visually pleasing, and user-friendly.</span></p>
            <p align = "justify">My teammates, Tim and Emily, were interns at Rotary who cited the lack of effective digital outreach as the main issue. 
                They showed me their website for reference.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "original1.jpg" alt = "original">

            <figcaption>"Stories" page which features their events.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">We quickly identified these problems:</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">1.</span> There isn't really a section that states what exactly Rotary is. 
                Users cannot get an idea of the work they do and therefore, will not feel inspired to get involved. <br><br>
                <span class = "bold">2.</span> If a user DOES want to get involved, there is no obvious place to sign up. Contact information is also scattered and 
                at times, somewhat hidden. <br><br>
                <span class = "bold">3.</span> The overall design is very old and not aesthetically pleasing. <br><br>
                <span class = "bold">4.</span> The photo on the home page just shows older people, giving off the impression that Rotary is not for the younger generation. <br><br>
                <span class = "bold">5.</span> The Stories page is straight-up unreadable.</p>
            <p align = "justify">The list goes on, but due to limited time (and me being the only team member with design experience), 
                we decided to focus on redesigning the home page and events page. For a branding guideline and general inspiration, 
                we visited the Rotary International website. What we decided to take from that was the usage of blue and gold 
                (Rotary's colors), and include a big "JOIN" and "DONATE" button in the top corner, that way if someone wants to 
                get involved or donate, they can do so easily.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "title">
            <h2>Sketches</h2>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "sketches.jpg" alt = "sketches">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">On the left is the home page. We set up the top similarly to the Rotary International website 
                (logo at the top left, JOIN and DONATE at the top right). We set the menu up to have all the information a 
                user would need: ABOUT Waltham Rotary, how to GET INVOLVED, any NEWS & EVENTS (changed from "Stories," which 
                we felt was less clear), and information specifically FOR MEMBERS. We decided to keep the text from the current
                website and push it to the top, since we felt that was a nice introduction. Then, we thought to promote upcoming events 
                below, and then at the bottom of every page, have contact information.</p>
            <p align = "justify">On the right upcoming events. "News & Events" is a drop-down menu that has news, 
                past events, and upcoming events. Clicking on "Upcoming Events" will lead to this page that lists 
                all future events. The user can click on each one to learn more and sign up. This is an intuitive way to see what 
                Waltham Rotary is up to and how to participate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>High Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "home.jpg" alt = "home">
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">The new home page.</span> Waltham Rotary currently does not have their own photos, so Tim sent 
                photos from Rotary International. We chose images that showed a mix of younger and older people, and people of 
                different races, to send the message that anyone can join Rotary. For the text at the top, I changed the 
                "Please join us" to a "Join Us" button. I originally wanted to link to a sign-up sheet, but Tim and Emily said 
                they don't have people register to meet beforehand. Thus, we decided it should link to Google Maps, showing directions from 
                your location to the location of the restaurant.<br><br>
                Scrolling down, the user can see some upcoming events. The user can click on each event and it'll lead them to that event page.<br><br>
                If the user scrolls down further, they'll find the Contact Us section shows all of Waltham Rotary's contact information. Currently, Waltham Rotary only has a 
                Facebook page, but we think if they also created a Twitter, Instagram etc., they can reach a greater number of 
                people in different engaging ways.</p>
        </div>
        <img class = "img" src = "events.png" alt = "events"><br>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify"><span class = "bold">Upcoming events.</span> The events are clearly listed, 
                with the event name, date, and brief description. If a user was interested in a particular event, 
                they can click "Learn more," and be directed to a page that describes the event in more detail and 
                gives them the option to register.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "title">
            <h2>Feedback & Reflection</h2>
        </div>
        <div class = "text">
            <p align = "justify">Responses from the judges were positive. They found our redesign to be much more
                intuitive and visually pleasing. Though my team did not end up winning, one of the judges came up 
                to us afterwards to tell us again how much they liked our work.
            </p>
            <p align = "justify">This was my first design hackathon, so I naturally learned a lot. Due to very limited time, 
                I had to prioritize what to work on and not get too caught up on every single detail. Given more time, I would 
                have liked to redesign/create more pages and test the new design.
